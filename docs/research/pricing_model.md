That's a solid strategy for a B2B SaaS MVP—a tiered, per-user model is simple, scalable, and easy to explain to target buyers (CTOs, HR leaders).

Here is a simple, effective **Per-User Pricing Model** that leverages your tiers to incentivize growth and commitment, structured for easy insertion into your PRD or pitch deck.

## 💰 Pricing Model: Tiered Per-User SaaS

TeamPulp will utilize a straightforward, recurring subscription model based on the number of active seats (users) within the customer organization. All tiers include access to the core features (Guided Video, AI Analysis, Bond Cards) and the Manager/Admin Dashboard.

### Tier Structure and Pricing

| Tier Name | User Count | Price Per User / Month | Target Customer & Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Launchpad** | Up to 9 Users | **$12 / user** | Ideal for small pilot teams or department POCs. Allows them to test the **Ritual** and see initial **Connection Scores**. |
| **Growth Engine** | 10 – 49 Users | **$10 / user** | Targets expanding teams ready to invest in building **Relationship Density** across a significant portion of their department. (Incentive: $2/user discount). |
| **Culture Catalyst** | 50+ Users | **$8 / user** | Targets larger, remote-first companies seeking an organization-wide data layer for culture health and retention. (Deepest discount for commitment). |

*(Note: Pricing numbers are examples and should be finalized based on market research, but the structure provides clear price breaks.)*

## Key Benefits of this Model

### 1. Simple & Predictable for Buyers
* **Zero Ambiguity:** Buyers know exactly what they will pay based on their current headcount, simplifying budgeting.
* **Scalable:** The model automatically scales revenue as the customer grows their team.

### 2. Incentivizes Commitment
* The clear price break at 10 users and 50 users incentivizes the customer to increase adoption internally to achieve a lower per-user rate.
* **The 50+ tier** encourages them to commit to TeamPulp as their official, org-wide relationship intelligence tool.

### 3. Supports MVP Goals
* **Launchpad Tier:** Perfect for your **Pilot Launch** milestone, allowing pilot groups to test the product with minimal initial cost commitment, which is crucial for proving value (NPS > 40).

Here is the recommendation and how to design the trial to maximize conversion:

## 🎁 Recommended Trial Model: 30-Day Free Pilot

The **30-day trial** is superior to a 7-day trial for your specific product because proving value takes time and requires completing your core ritual (the bi-weekly connection).

### Why 30 Days Works Best for TeamPulp

| Trial Length | Pros for TeamPulp | Cons for TeamPulp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7-Day** | Faster initial sign-ups. | **Fatal Flaw:** The customer cannot complete your bi-weekly ritual (one full **Nurture Run**) or generate enough data for the AI to produce meaningful **Culture Health** insights. |
| **30-Day** | **Allows for 2 full Connection cycles.** Provides enough data (4 connections for a 4-person team) to populate the **Manager/Admin Dashboard** with actionable data. | Slightly longer commitment required from the buyer. |

The key to proving value for your product is delivering the first **"A-Ha!" moment** (seeing the Relationship Graph, the Sentiment Trend, and the Bond Cards) within the trial period. This requires 3-4 weeks of data.

## Trial Structure: The "Pilot Launch" Funnel

The trial should be structured as a commitment-free pilot of your **Launchpad** tier (up to 9 users).

### 1. Trial Terms

* **Duration:** **30 Days, No Credit Card Required.**
* **Tier:** **Launchpad** (limited to 9 seats). This mimics your lowest paid tier, ensuring they experience the true product.
* **Feature Access:** Full access to all **Core Features** and the **Manager/Admin Dashboard**. *Crucially, they must see the analytics.*

### 2. The Conversion Trigger

The goal is to align the value delivery with the trial end.

| Trial Period | User Action Required | Value Delivered / Conversion Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 - 7** | Configure the **Chat Schedule** and complete the first **Connection**. | Initial excitement and ease of use (low friction). |
| **Day 14** | Complete the second **Connection** and fill out the post-chat micro-survey (Psychological Safety Pulse). | The system generates the first set of **Bond Cards** and displays the initial **Participation Rate** on the Manager Dashboard. |
| **Day 28** | The system aggregates the data from both bi-weekly cycles into the first **Monthly Interval** report. | **THE A-HA! MOMENT:** The Admin/Manager sees a trend line for **Aggregated Sentiment** and the **Relationship Graph** populated with genuine connections. |
| **Day 30** | Trial expires. | **Conversion Push:** "Unlock continuous relationship intelligence for your team by subscribing now. Keep your data and insights." |

### 3. Pricing Transition

On Day 30, the user must be prompted to choose a paid tier.

* **If the team is $\le 9$ users:** They convert directly to the **Launchpad** tier ($12/user/month).
* **If the team wants to expand (e.g., 15 users):** They must immediately select the **Growth Engine** tier ($10/user/month) and pay for all 15 seats.

This transition leverages the data you've proven is valuable and asks them to formalize their usage based on their commitment to team health.
