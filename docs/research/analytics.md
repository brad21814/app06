# Analytics & Insight Strategy

This document defines the core metrics and advanced AI-driven insights for TeamPulp. The goal is to provide **Relationship Intelligence** that helps HR and Engineering Leaders measure culture, reduce isolation, and improve team cohesion.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Relationship Health" Score

To provide immediate value, we will aggregate data into three high-level pillars for the Manager Dashboard:

1.  **Participation (Quantity):** Are people showing up?
2.  **Connection Quality (Quality):** Are the interactions positive and balanced?
3.  **Network Density (Reach):** Are silos being broken?

## 2. Core Operational Metrics (Hard Data)

These metrics are derived from the `connections` and `participants` data without requiring AI analysis. They measure the adoption and usage of the platform.

| Metric | Definition | Value to HR/Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Participation Rate** | % of scheduled pairings that result in a "Completed" connection (Duration > 30s). | Basic measure of program adoption and "buy-in". |
| **Schedule Adherence** | % of connections that happen within the suggested time window. | Indicator of workload capacity and prioritization of culture. |
| **Video Usage Rate** | % of time camera was on during calls (if trackable via Twilio). | Proxy for engagement and vulnerability. |
| **Missed Connections** | Count of "No-shows" or cancellations. | Early warning signal for disengaged employees or burnout. |

## 3. Advanced GenAI Metrics (The "Vibe" Check)

These metrics are generated by processing the **transcripts** through an LLM. They provide the qualitative "pulse" of the organization that surveys often miss.

### A. Sentiment & Energy
*   **Global Sentiment Score (0-100):** A weighted average of the emotional tone of the conversation.
    *   *0-40 (Concern):* High friction, negative language, complaints.
    *   *41-70 (Neutral):* Professional, transactional, polite.
    *   *71-100 (Thriving):* Enthusiastic, laughter, gratitude, high energy.
*   **Energy Level:** inferred from speaking pace, interruptions (laughter), and exclamation usage.
    *   *High:* Dynamic, fast-paced, excited.
    *   *Medium:* Steady, conversational, balanced.
    *   *Low:* Slow, hesitant, tired.

### B. Interaction Dynamics
*   **Conversation Balance (0.0 - 1.0):** Measures the equality of participation.
    *   *1.0:* Perfect 50/50 split of speaking time/turn-taking.
    *   *< 0.4:* Lopsided conversation (one person dominating).
*   **Active Listening Score:** Detects follow-up questions ("Tell me more about..."), validations ("That makes sense"), and callbacks to previous statements.

### C. Psychological Safety Signals
*   **Vulnerability Markers:** Detection of phrases indicating sharing of personal challenges or admission of mistakes (e.g., "I struggled with...", "I'm worried about...").
*   **Supportiveness:** Frequency of encouraging statements (e.g., "You got this", "Great job").

## 4. Organizational Health Metrics (Network Graph)

These metrics visualize the structure of relationships within the company.

| Metric | Definition | Value to HR/Management |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relationship Density** | Actual Connections / Total Possible Connections. (0.0 to 1.0). | How "tight-knit" is the team? Higher is generally better for trust. |
| **Silo Risk Score** | Measures the lack of connections *between* different functional groups (e.g., Eng vs. Design). | Identifies communication gaps that cause product issues. |
| **Isolation Alert** | Flag for individuals who have had 0 connections in the last X cycles or low sentiment scores. | **Critical retention metric.** Identifies at-risk employees who need manager 1:1 attention. |
| **"Super-Connector" ID** | Identification of individuals who have high sentiment and high cross-team density. | Identify cultural carriers/influencers who can lead initiatives. |

## 5. Content & Theme Analysis

What are people actually talking about?

*   **Trending Topics (Work):** e.g., "Deadlines", "New Architecture", "Burnout", "Hiring".
*   **Trending Topics (Personal):** e.g., "Travel", "Dogs", "Gaming", "Kids".
*   **Values Alignment:** Frequency of keywords related to company values (e.g., "Ownership", "curiosity", "Simplicity").

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### GenAI Prompting Strategy
When processing a transcript, we will ask the LLM (Gemini/OpenAI) to return a JSON object with the following schema:

```json
{
  "summary": "2-sentence summary for the Bond Card.",
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
  "sentiment_score": 85,
  "sentiment_reasoning": "Both participants laughed frequently and shared excitement about the upcoming launch.",
  "interaction_balance_score": 0.9,
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Participant A is excited about X",
    "Participant B is worried about Y"
  ],
  "flags": {
    "burnout_risk": false,
    "hr_violation_risk": false
  }
}
```

### Data Privacy & Ethics
*   **Aggregation:** Managers should generally see *aggregated* sentiment and trends, not individual transcript details, to preserve psychological safety.
*   **Visibility:** "Isolation Alerts" should be the only individual-level flags pushed to managers, framed as "Check in on [Name]" rather than "Low Performance".
