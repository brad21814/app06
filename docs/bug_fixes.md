A few modifications to be made to our auth feature...
1. When a non-invited user signs up we should ask them for name and timezone, org name, but not team name. 
2. When we invite a user we should assign them a team when we add there email address.
3. We should be able to see a list of invited users and their status 'accepted', 'invited', 'rejected'.
